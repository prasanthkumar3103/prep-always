high availability plugin



2 new ec2,which we will serve as jenkins master
EFS(nfs):- we will mount file system in each of jenkins master(var/lib/jenkins/job)

var/lib/jenkins/job: this location shares the jobs b/w 2 masters



1st master will be active node

2nd master will be passive node(passive is for if active node goes down ,passive takes care)


created same id b/w 2 masters with private key of ssh(id name :jenkins)



go to EFS

create file system

name file system :jenkins

go with next default steps


mount file system to jenkins


yum -y install nfs-utils

vi /etc/fstab

end of the file add mount info

eu-west-1a.dnanameofefsfilesystem(fs-1cxxxx.efs.eu-west-1.amazon.com):/var/lib/jenkins/jobs nfs defaults 0 0
savefile

nfs : telling to file that nfs is file system.

systemctl stop jenkins

mount /var/lib/jenkins/jobs
df -h

fs-1cxxxx.efs.eu-west-1.amazon.com:/ /var/lib/jenkins/jobs

ls -l /var/lib/jenkins/jobs

here jobs directory pointed to root,change it to jenkins id
chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/jobs
ls -l /var/lib/jenkins/jobs
systemctl start jenkins


follow the same steps for 2nd master as well.


create a one job in 1stmaster and run

go to 2nd master and reload jenkins(to reload jenkins data)
(to reload we can create cron to reload config in script)

vi /etc/cron.d/jenkins_reload
*/1  * * * * root /bin/bash /opt/jenkins_reload.sh

jenkins_reload : cron name

run a job from 1st node ,cron will take care of move jobs

go to 3rd server for LB;-
